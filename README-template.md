## Overview

### The challenge

It was about building this order summary card component and making it as close to the design as possible.

The tools used for practice were the Visual Studio Code text editor for writing scripts and the Chrome browser for viewing the result of the source code.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

What I learned is particularly focused on CSS. First, I learned how to make web pages responsive using media queries. I also learned how to use the CSS property `align-items`, which is used to align child elements along the cross axis in a container with `display: flex` (flexbox) or `display: grid`. It controls the vertical alignment (by default) of items in a flex container, or based on the secondary axis in a grid.

Here are the main values for `align-items`:

- `flex-start`: aligns items at the beginning of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: aligns items at the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: centers items along the cross axis.
- `baseline`: aligns items to their text baseline.
- `stretch` (default value): stretches items to fill the available space along the cross axis.

I also learned how to use Google Fonts and integrate the font link using the `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">` tag. Among these fonts, I used the Roboto font.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to improve my skills in frontend development, including these languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I also want to be able to use a frontend technology effectively (React Js) for creating web interfaces, and I would like to enhance my skills in making web pages responsive. If possible, I would also like to learn a backend technology (Django).
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) - This allowed me to see how to use flexbox, justify-content, and Google Fonts.
